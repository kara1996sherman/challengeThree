# challengeThree
Challenge Three requires me to modify starter code to create an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria of including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, as well as a password length between 8-128 characters.

# What I learned:
In this project, I learned some fundamentals of Javascript. I learned how to select elements in HTML using query selectors. I learned how to declare variables in the local and global scope, and how to create arrays as variables. I learned how to create a function, if (), then execute code in {}. I also learned how to use for loops to loop through an array. Additionally, learned how to use Math.random to pick a random index, and Math.Floor to round that number to the nearest whole number. I learned about event listeners, and how to use them to execute something on a webpage. In this case, on "click", the javascript excuted the function writePassword.

# Installation
N/A

# Usage
To use this webpage, a user clicks "generate password" button. A window will pop up asking user to select criteria- 
1. Choose a password length between 8-128 characters (must enter a number)
2. To include lowercase letters
3. To include upper case letters
4. To include numbers
5. To include special characters

After selecting yes, the program generates a random password in the box that meet all of the above requirements.
